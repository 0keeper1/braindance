## About Braindance

The name "Braindance" comes from [Cyberpunnk 2077](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Braindance#Braindance), it's written in *Rust*, I created this project for myself, so don't expect it to be more user-friendly than it currently is. And If you've ever needed something, feel free to ask.
<br>
If you've ever needed to customize the editor, you have to recompile the editor to do so.
<br>
Also, Feel free to fork.

## Features

- It is fast! The editor is not based on configuration files; hence, it makes it faster, both at startup, runtime or for common use!
- It is customizable! You can customize every part of it.
