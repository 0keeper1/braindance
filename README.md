## About Braindance

**Braindance** gets its name from the [Cyberpunk 2077](https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Braindance#Braindance)
universe. It is written entirely in pure **C** using only standard libraries. This project was created for personal use,
so it may not prioritize user-friendliness.

If customization is needed, youâ€™ll have to recompile the editor with your changes.

Feel free to fork and make it your own!

## Features

- Lightweight and fast
- Built entirely in C with no external dependencies
- Intended for developers who prioritize speed and minimalism over user-friendliness
